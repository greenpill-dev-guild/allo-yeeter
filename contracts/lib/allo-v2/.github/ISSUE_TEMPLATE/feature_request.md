## Problem
> Summarize the raw idea, use case, or something you’ve seen that motivates us to work on this.

## Apetite
> Select one of the following and delete the other. Add any nuance below. How much time are we willing to spend on this and how does that constrain the solution?

**Small Batch:** This is a project that a team of one designer and one or two programmers can build in one or two weeks. We batch these together into a six week cycle (more on that later).

**Big Batch:** This project takes the same-size team a full six-weeks.

## Solution
> The core elements you came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to understand. Drawings and doodles are very encouraged.

### References
> Provide a list or overview of references helpful in understanding the problem or solution


### Rabbit Holes
> What additional details about the solution are worth calling out? What things are we specifically trying to avoid?


### Planning Docs
> List or provide any other, related planning docs that will help someone grok the problem or solution
