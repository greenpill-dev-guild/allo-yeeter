/// @notice This contract allows people to grant tokens to beneficiaries that vest over time with the added functionalities;
/// Each vesting plan is a unique NFT, leveraging the backbone of the ERC721 contract to represent a unique vesting plan
/// 1. Revokable: plans can be revoked and unvested tokens returned to the company (vesting admin)
/// 2. Soul Bound: plans are by default soul bound and not transferable, however can be transferred by an admin in emergencies
/// 3. Governance optimized for snapshot voting: These are built to allow beneficiaries to vote with their unvested tokens on snapshot, or delegate them to other delegatees
/// 4. Beneficiary Claims: Beneficiaries get to choose when to claim their tokens, and can claim partial amounts that are less than the amount they vested for tax optimization
