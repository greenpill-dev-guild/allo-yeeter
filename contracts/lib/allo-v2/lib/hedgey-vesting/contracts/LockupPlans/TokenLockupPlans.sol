/// @title TokenLockupPlans - An efficient way to allocate tokens to beneficiaries that unlock over time
/// @notice This contract allows people to grant tokens to beneficiaries that unlock over time with the added functionalities;
/// Owners of unlock plans can manage all of their token unlocks across all of their positions in a single contract.
/// Each lockup plan is a unique NFT, leveraging the backbone of the ERC721 contract to represent a unique lockup plan
/// 1. Not-Revokable: plans cannot be revoked, once granted the entire amount will be claimable by the beneficiary over time.
/// 2. Transferable: Lockup plans can be transferred by the owner - opening up defi opportunities like NFT sales, borrowing and lending, and many others.
/// 3. Governance optimized for snapshot voting: These are built to allow beneficiaries to vote with their locked tokens on snapshot, or delegate them to other delegatees
/// 4. Beneficiary Claims: Beneficiaries get to choose when to claim their tokens, and can claim partial amounts that are less than the amount they have unlocked for tax optimization
/// 5. Segmenting plans: Beneficiaries can segment a single lockup into  smaller chunks for subdelegation of tokens, or to use in defi with smaller chunks
/// 6. Combingin Plans: Beneficiaries can combine plans that have the same details in one larger chunk for easier bulk management
