We have also learned a lot about the creation, coordination and execution of community lead events.\n\nDuring Zuzalu the Blockravers house was open to anyone that wanted to come, meet us IRL and obtained a bolivar for playing with web of trust primitives. Our house hosted workshops around coordinations, self issue identities and also some epic gatherings that left us all dreaming biggere.\n\nDuring Zuconnect, we also hosted and curated almost every single day events and activities for those that wanted to share. We have hosted some incredible workshops, dinners, celebrations and even experiments with teams like the PSE's Jubmoji.\n\nWe will continue creating spaces where humanity, art, culture, creativity and love are at the center.

We will measure this with metrics like the number of attendees (aiming for 1000+ in 2024), NPS Review Scores (Aiming for over 4.8/5), and how many people go on to start their own similar projects.\n\n2) **Local Impact:** We have a goal to drive real world impact through our activations. For example, for the event in Southeast Asia, we will be doing outreach work and getting local communities engaging with crypto products. We will use metrics like “Number of new people with an ENS domain” to track the efficacy of this initiative. We have a related goal of encouraging IRL applications of crypto, with products like Daimo and ZuPass.\n\n3) **Accelerating resident impact and incubating projects:** Our gatherings are perfectly designed for collaboration and growth. We want to empower attendees to do their most impactful work by helping them incubate projects within the community. We will measure this with metrics like the number of open-source projects that we see developed or meaningfully grown over people’s time in Edge City.\n\n4) **Advancing governance and community models:** We aim to demonstrate new models of community living. Innovation villages are IRL labs for new decision-making and organizational models, allowing us to try innovative governance and community designs that align with the development of technology and infrastructure. We will measure this with metrics like the number of times attendees engage in novel governance models at each village and metrics on individual health outcomes.\n\nUltimately, we will measure our impact based on the real-world tangible impact that our community members and their projects will have. To do so, we will continue to foster a culture of open source and public goods innovation.",

We want the ~150 hundred full-time residents (as well as the many visitors) to have an incredible experience and leave inspired to help build the movement as it grows.\n\n- A **6-8 week popup village in the fall in South East Asia.** The goal is to bring together several hundred people for another long-term event as part of the road to DevCon 2024. We want to create an environment for global innovators to come together and explore multidisciplinary and multicultural collaboration. This event will be familiar in style and structure to many who have been to Zuzalu before but with an even greater emphasis on health and making it accessible to folks with children.\n\nThe funding from the QF round will go directly towards organizing these pop-up villages.

This will be achieved by establishing a network of houses in key cities, each addressing a different problem and attracting local talent to collaboratively work on BCI superintelligence projects.\n\nDescription:\nJUJALU CoBrain, an interdisciplinary event focusing on BCI and brain longevity, seeks to establish a network of BCI movement houses in potential locations such as New York, New Jersey, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and Boston. Each house will address specific challenges humanity faces in maintaining consciousness with continuity and merging biological brains with the power of silicon to enhance our potential as intelligent beings. A significant obstacle in merging biological and silicon brains is the lack of collaboration between the two fields, as BCI experts often lack biological knowledge, and biologists lack computer engineering expertise.\n\nTheme Houses:\n1. Self-Preservation House: Focus on brain tissue replacement.\n2. BCI Mass Adoption House: Specialize in robotic surgery.\n3. Silicon-Made Brain Tissue House: Develop the Implantable Chip project.\n4. CoBrain House: Identify key interface requirements.\n\nKey Features:\n1. Network of BCI Houses: Each house focuses on unique challenges to accelerate the field.\n2. Collaborative Co-Living: Shared spaces for biologists, software, and hardware engineers interested in BCI to live, work, and innovate together.\n3. Decentralized Science Funding: Use blockchain technology for funding solutions, such as issuing IP NFTs, and create preclinical trial DAOs for crowdfunding.\n4. BCI-ACC Movement Engagement: Organize events like Central Park runs and ice skating in Boston to engage broader talent pools and promote healthy lifestyles.\n\nGoals:\n- Develop a sustainable BCI talent base for ongoing collaboration over the next five years.\n- Incubate research projects with market-potential IP and prototype hacks for experiments.\n\nFunding Request:\n- Funds for the initial phase of establishing and renting 1-2 houses.\n- Capital for 1-2 house operations, such as equipment purchases, and a one-month food budget for group living.\n\nTimeline:\n- ETHDenver Kick-off: [Feb 26]\n- Operation of BCI Houses: [March 15] - [April 15]\n\nThis proposal leverages the unique capabilities offered by countries with looser regulatory restrictions, like Honduras, to drive invasive chip implant studies on real humans.

As a Zuzalu spin-off, Digitalia aims to use the village-event format to create value for a local community and the socio-economic landscape of the country of Italy by bringing digital public goods to life.\nWe see Digitalia as a contribution and continuation to Zuzalu by leveraging the software Zuzalu.city and Zupass. Digitalia will be listed on Zuzalu.city and the ticketing and ZK check-ins will be powered by Zupass. We see great value in having the opportunity to keep testing the tools and experimenting with new use cases that can emphasize the Zuzalu principles through his digital infrastructure, and consequently create new value for Zuzalians to benefit from them after us. \nWe hope that Digitalia's learnings will add overall value and a diverse perspective on experiences gained during the 2024 archipelago of Zu-Villages worldwide, and can contaminate other Zuzalians. We want Digitalia to become a model for future similar spin-offs, aiming not only to establish Italy as an attractive business hub for Zuzalians but also to welcome more digital nomad communities.\nIn an era of economic uncertainty in Italy, Digitalia can act as another example to gain experience by testing Zuzalu as a new operating system for future civilization models to thrive, providing a model for encouraging solutions, decentralized leadership, and optimism for a more sustainable future.",

This event enables an alternative space for people to gather and discuss the topics important to Zuzalu community members.\n\n2.) It plays host to a number of families embedded in the ecosystem who currently can't justify attending an event that caters exclusively to founders or technical attendees. We believe the best approach to building a new society is to include the whole family, kids, parents, even grandparents are all welcome and provided for at MetaCamp.\n\n3.) Beginning this year, having tested and gained faith in our methodology, we plan to share our agendas, activities, and learnings in a public and open forum such as discourse so that other communities can iterate and improve upon what we are doing and grow the movement together.",

Similar to the 2-month pop up city in Montenegro, we’ve also successfully run multiple 2-month residencies in rural Japan as pilot programs for our project. Our community was primarily communicating on a digital platform, so this was the first temporary physical space that we were able to converge in. (2) A network state: we’re a group of highly aligned members who coordinate online, with the aim of purchasing property in multiple regions of rural Japan. We support a network of home owners in acquiring, renovating, and operating properties in tight-knit regions for cohabitation and coworking. (3) Focused on frontier technologies: our project explores how digital and physical space interact with each other. While VR and AR focus on digital worldbuilding, we are using these technologies to prototype, iterate, and work together towards creating a more persistent manifestation in the physical world. In addition to these aspects, we are focused on learning how space and culture influences wellbeing and health of its constituents: how do structures ritual and collaboration to emerge?",

                "answer": "The first iteration of Zuzalu did an incredible job in creating a pop-up city in Montenegro that attracted a large amount of visitors united with similar values and culture. While this may have contributed to the local economy during that time, and opportunities for experiencing another culture, we are interested in learning more about the long-term sustainability impacts of these pop-up cities: are participants interested in potentially moving to the city to continue contributing to the economy long term? How much interaction occurred between temporary visitors and locals? Were there many locals that took part in workshops at Zuzalu? What we’re doing at Akiya Collective focuses on these questions, as well as how to promote more memetic value.\n\n1) Local revitalization: We are actively learning how integration from our online community can happen with existing cities and locales — this is a balancing act of learning how to thrive in the surrounding environment with those who have been there for generations, while also maintaining and contributing our own culture that we bring from various geographical contexts. Our residency had ~30% of locals to international guests — this is reflected in our Discord member list as well. It’s important to integrate local perspectives to provide input and cultural exchange that made interactions meaningful, diversified, and have the capability to build on top of each other. It’s about balancing cultural syncretism and preservation in a way that motions toward established life-ways and architectures (social, ecological, built-environmental).\n\n2) Persistent cultural artifacts: While Zuzalu had a strong art presence across various mediums, there hasn’t been a strong movement of Zuzalu native art telling our story, symbolizing our culture, or creating memes.\n    - Art is also important for shaping the physical spaces we live in and the thoughts and feelings we have while we are there, an important part of community health and wellbeing. Beauty is a public good, and spaces and artifacts will communicate value well beyond the transient visitors who come to help create it\n    - Akiya Collective will be hosting residencies in Japan devoted to visualizing Zuzalian culture in various media to increase the longevity of the community and its values.",

              "description": "**TL;DR:** Ayllu is a one month and a half pop-up city in Venezuela with its focus on well-being, systemic change, and social impact, in partnership with diverse local stakeholders and hosted by the Ethereum Venezuela community.\n\n# The Invitation\n\nThere was once a fabled crypto nation, a land of faux democracy and hyperinflation, where once conquistadores got lost seeking El Dorado, and where the turn of the century saw every possible aspect of the human condition slowly collapse but the ability to dream (we call this “realismo mágico”), paving the way for every use case cypherpunks could ever imagine to be tested, from governance to finance, digital identity to privacy, where folks dreamt of transparency from illegally extracted commodities to humanitarian help, where the crypto mining lungs of the Americas were once filled, and where an appetite for risk is still part of our diet.\n\nWhat can we learn from the Venezuelan story? You are invited to find an answer to this question alongside us.\n\n# **The Proposal**\n\nWe plan to host a one month and a half pop up city either in Caracas, Margarita Island, or a mix, with its focus on wellbeing, systemic change, and social impact, in partnership with local and international NGOs and grassroots organizations, private sector groups of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and the Ethereum Venezuela community. The program’s focus will have a hands-on approach at the core with co-designed tracks by attendees matched with local leaders for guidance in maximizing local impact. We believe a deep dive into these topics will be of great value to Zuzalu’s network.\n\n## **Some of our goals include:**\n\n- Expose 50+ attendees to LATAM from the perspective of Venezuela and to the use cases that inspired the early adopters of crypto and blockchain technologies.\n- Host work sessions twice a week to evaluate restarting the Margarita Network State Project producing a report and solid next steps after the residency.\n- Explore alternative funding methods for cyber-physical public goods like parks and neighborhoods, running at least one pilot alongside local partners.\n- Soft launch [Ayllu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayllu) (think Afropolitan for LATAM) alongside [Ashoka](https://www.ashoka.org/) Diaspora Networks.\n- And more to be co-designed alongside participants.\n\nThis grant’s funds will be used to set up operations, develop our brand, launch our online presence, and continue to expand on the ideas presented here in an open way, allowing the community to take part in the design and have a say from day one in the programming, and choosing the specific location and dates of the gathering.\n\n# **Why Venezuela?**\n\n## **An Early Network State Promise**\n\nVenezuela once had an independent digital jurisdiction plan very similar to how network states are envisioned today. The years are 2017-18 and the setting is Isla de Margarita. It is mostly unknown that in parallel to the regulation of crypto mining and exchanges and the creation of the government-sponsored “crypto-currency”, [Petro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_(token)), the local powers had the plan to turn the island [Estate of Nueva Esparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Esparta) and its core two peninsulas of Margarita, with its 1,151 km2 (444 sq mi) and almost half a million inhabitants into an independent digital jurisdiction backed by currency, governance, and identity blockchain systems. This plan came to be with the support of governance OG crypto startup, [Bitnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitnation).\n\n## **Crypto-Savy Population**\n\nGreatly in part to achieving an [overall inflation rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela) of 53,798,500% since 2016, Venezuela has commonly been known across the blockchain space since its early days, slowly declining in relevance but once hailed almost as the holy grail of crypto adoption. The country once held a top place across most indicators, from [trading](https://medium.com/open-money-initiative/latin-american-bitcoin-trading-follows-the-heartbeat-of-venezuela-71a28cb86ba0) to [mining](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/cheap-electricity-a-boon-for-bitcoin-mining-in-cash-strapped-venezuela/articleshow/85824225.cms?from=mdr), only to fall fast and hard after government regulation, but in parallel having crypto set front and center by this same government’s own token initiative, the ([recently defunct](https://www.barrons.com/news/venezuela-kills-off-petro-cryptocurrency-1e2b0317)) Petro. To this day, even if the average Venezuelan has a slight know-how of what crypto is, the population has moved 92.5% of total transactions to CEX’s, according to [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/). And Binance and USDT are top of mind when chatting to locals. Regardless, and in the same Chainalysis report, you can find a dedicated section on “[cryptocurrency as a weapon against authoritarianism](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/latin-america-cryptocurrency-adoption/)” in Venezuela. So, what changed and what can we learn from it?\n\n## **Sacred Nature & Healing**\n\nWe’ve partnered with [Eposak](https://www.eposak.org/), the social impact branch of Grupo Maso, the most influential tourism operator of the country, to explore having an offsite to Canaima and visit [Mount Roraima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGv_MitUe7A), one of Earth’s oldest geological formations, composed of Proterozoic age sandstone formed about 1.7 to 2 billion years ago and the inspiration for the Disney/Pixar movie Up. Alongside Eposak and Ashoka,  our team leader is currently exploring the use of web3, mixed-reality, and other technologies in generating alternative sources of income for local communities in the area.\n\n# **Team, Contacts & Other Round Eligibility Questions**\n\nThe team is made of four of the 28 Ethereum Venezuela volunteers and is led by one of its co-founders, Daniel K. ([@kosmostasis](https://t.me/kosmostasis)) who has been in the space since 2010. He’s been a former contributor to Bitnation, Democracy Earth Foundation, RadicalxChange, Commons Stack, Token Engineering Commons, and IoTeX, among others. He’s a co-instigator of the B Corps and Singularity University communities in Venezuela, as well as the civic innovation space LABO Ciudadano, former Alumni Network Vice-Chair of the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative and a Kernel Block II fellow, he’s also supported many different initiatives both locally and regionally that allow him to keep a multi-stakeholder approach to systemic change. K attended both Zuzalu ‘23 as a Visitor and ZuConnect as a Resident. Here’s his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knobelsdorf/) for a more complete profile. We aim to recruit other leaders of the web3 space of Venezuelan origin as advisors or core team members.\n\nYou can find us at https://t.me/ayllufam and [ayllufam@gmail.com](mailto:ayllufam@gmail.com). The initiative has no prior funding, or on-chain attestations/impact certificates.",
